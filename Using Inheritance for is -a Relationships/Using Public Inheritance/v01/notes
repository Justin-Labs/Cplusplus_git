Our first taks of public inheritance, that is, a derived calss relationship. see GraduateStudent.h.
Public inheritance is by far the most common type of inheritance in C++, and it's commonly used to 
express is-a relationships. 

All of the member vaiables and methods avilable in the class Student are also going to be available in 
GraduateStudent.

line 5 of GraduateStudent.h is our first example of our first use of the inheritance. 
class GraduateStudent : public Student {

This line of code makes it clear that GraduateStudent derives from or inherits from the student class.
The type of inheritance is public. That's because of the keyword public. It's commonly used to 
express is-a relationships.
