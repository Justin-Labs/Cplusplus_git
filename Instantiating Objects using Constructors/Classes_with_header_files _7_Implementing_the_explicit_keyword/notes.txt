A constructor is a special method, which has the same name as the class that it belongs in , and it's going
to be invoked every time an object of the class is constructed. It's possible for a class to have more than 
one constructor, and there's also something know as the default no argument constructor.

There is a problem when you have two default values for  both of the input argument and a default value with 
no input arguments at all.
If you have two different overloaded functions and the default values make it ambiguous which one of them 
ought to be invoked, the compiler will throw. How can we get rid of this compiler error? There are a couple
of options. One is to eleminate the default values from one or both of the input arguments to the 
parameterized constructor. Another is to get rid of the default no argument constructor.

For const member variables, an initialization list is the only way to appropriately initlize them.
