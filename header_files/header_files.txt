added this line to the tasks.json file in the "args" section
"${workspaceFolder}/*.cpp",  this tells the compiler to link 
in the math_utility.cpp file the the workspaceFolder that
we are currently in.

That didn't work possible due to my large dir struct.
so I switched to to "${fileDirname}/*.cpp", which worked
once I changed my original file to a .C file so compiler wouldn't
try and compile it with the math_utility.cpp and cause
errors due to multiple definitions.

or we can just manually invoke g++ and include both cpp files that
way.
