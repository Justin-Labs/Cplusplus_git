Here in this example we use the using statement to access namespaces like shapes and constants to reduce some of the 
coding in our files. see shapes_util.cpp.

Do keep in mind it's fine to use the using statement in the .cpp files, however it is not fine to use this in the .h 
files. So, within the .h files, we should continue having fully referenced  names for our types.

Also note that even if you use this, there is nothing preventing you from still using the fully qualified name,
for instance see the main.cpp file.
