friend void display_transaction_report(const BankAccount& bank_account)

introducing friend function.
Its called display_transaction_report on the above line of code, is a friend function of return type void 
that takes in one input argument of type const BankAccount&.

a "friend" gets access to all parts of this class. That includes all member variables and methods which 
are in the private as well as the public sections.

turns out the use of friend here is gratuitous, and using a getter would have been easier.
There are still circumstances in which the friend keyword is required and not just a nice to have.

Here we have moved the implementation of friend from the main.cpp to  the BankAccount.cpp starting line 51.
