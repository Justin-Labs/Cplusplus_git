You'll  notice that we declared shapes namespace in circle.h and then again in circle.cpp. And this is perfectly 
acceptable to the compiler. 
We did this both to slightly reduce the amount of text in the code compared to the V02 folder, and to show that
it works fine.
The compiler will combine or concatenated and the union will be taken as the total contents of that namespace.
