inline was only added to C++ in C++17

If there are multiple CPP files which happen to pull in these constants, those definitions will all be resolved by the 
linker into just the same underlying object. Ther will only be one version of the const double pi, and that's again 
because of the inline keyword that you see here on lines 3 and 4 of constants.h.

One bit of terminology, we've been referring to .cpp files, but you should know that the technical term here is a 
translation unit. In C++, very roughly, a translation usnit is equivalent to 1.cpp file. In this particular code, you 
can see in the list of files over on the left, that we have multiple translation units, Circle.cpp, shape_util.cpp, 
and main.cpp.
