Nested Classes
BankAccount.h has Nested Class

In this example its located in the Private section of the BankAccount Class
so the Nested CreditCard class is only going to be accessible from within the
BankAccount class.

A Nested class is a class that has its definition inside the definition of another class.

I noticed that this didn't actually correct the credit limit after payment.
