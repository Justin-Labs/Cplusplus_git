A constructor is a special method, which has the same name as the class that it belongs in , and it's going
to be invoked every time an object of the class is constructed. It's possible for a class to have more than 
one constructor, and there's also something know as the default no argument constructor.

Remember how we've already discussed that when input arguments are passed by value, a copy is created.
And how is that copy going to be created? Using the copy constructor of course. So if we try to pass
in the first input argument by value, that triggers a call to the copy constructor. However, this is itself
 the copy constructor and this leads to infinite recursion. This explains why the input argument into
 a copy constructor is always going to be a const reference.

 This one shows problem with trying to pass by value into objects variables. They value reverts as soon
 as we return to the calling function. Or more precisely the copied value doesn't exist on the global scope, 
 but only in the local scope and that doesn't change the global variable.
