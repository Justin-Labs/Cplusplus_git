This time we will be working with variables on the heap or free store.
This time with array new and array delete, which we have to use a default 
no argument constructor, or create our own no argument constructor. This is
because the only kind of constructor that array new knows about is the 
no-argument constructor.


The term static means something very different in C++ than it does in C.
In C, static referred to a storage class for specific types of variables.
In C++ however, the term static is used for member functions or member variables
which are not associated with individual objects of a class, but rather with
the class as a whole.

The important bit to note here is that we are ables to access student.major, 
even though major is a private member variable of the student class. This
happened because a static member function is a full member of the class and
this means that in terms of privileges, any object of that class which is passed
in  as an argument to a static member function will give access to its private
as well as public members to the static method. 
(see Student.cpp)

also as a reminder there is no this pointer available inside a static method.
